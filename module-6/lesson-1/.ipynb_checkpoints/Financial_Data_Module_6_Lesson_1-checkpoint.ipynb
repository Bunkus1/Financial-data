Then, we can search tweets from the past seven days that mention whatever query word we like, for example a company's name or ticker. Once we have this dataset of tweets, we can perform our sentiment analysis: How frequently are various basic emotions evidenced in the text of the tweets that mention the company we are interested in? But tweets and their relevant data (country of origin, creation time, language) are stored in JSON objects. JSON objects are a very common format for data, so we will invest some time in understanding the structure and syntax of this data object.*"

    "## 1. The Twitter API\n",
    "API stands for application programming interface. An API is how one computer or program \"interfaces\" or interacts with another computer or program. That means it is also how we users interface with computers or programs. The Twitter API is how we users (use the Python noteboooks on our computers to) interface with the Twitter database of tweets.\n",

    "* Go to Twitter.com and get a Twitter account if you don't have one yet.\n",
    "* Sign in to the developer site [https://developer.twitter.com/en](https://developer.twitter.com/en) using your Twitter account\n",
    "* Now you need to register as an applications (app) developer\n",
    "* Go to [https://apps.twitter.com/app/new](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) \n",
    "* Give your new app a name and a description - you can be creative\n",
    "* Enter anything for website \n",
    "* Leave callback url blank\n",
    "* Read and accept the terms and conditions to create an account\n",
    "* Then, click on the \"Keys and Access Tokens\" tab\n",
    "* Copy the two consumer keys to a text file\n",
    "* Scroll down and click \"Generate Access key and Secret\"\n",
    "* Copy the two access keys to the text file\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: With this free Twitter API v2, you will get an error unless your search dates are within the last seven days. Also, you can only download 500,000 tweets per month. For this reason, be conservative and restrict your start and end times, especially if you are investigating tweets for very well-known companies, like AAPL (Apple) and GOOG (Alphabet / Google). Just a 30-minute block of time (the difference between start time and end time is 30 minutes) is actually sufficient to do some exploratory analysis on such large companies. Much smaller companies may require several hours or even days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note too that using the client.sample() method does not count against the 500K tweet limit. These tweets may not include a reference to the company you are investigating, but it could still be interesting. Once downloaded, you can also filter these tweets for whatever interests you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twarc is a library that will make it a lot easier for us to search and access Twitter through its API. [For more background on Twarc, see this site,](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2_en_us/) [and this site.](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc/blob/4bff06bb8f2e279ea0a2064d6bfaec3c9b4b3aff/docs/api/library.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note from the documentation above that Twarc is a command line tool, but we have adapted it with [this code](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research/blob/f3b5b40d197ecaac133299eea46fefcced569d21/modules/6b-labs-code-standard-python.md) to run from a notebook as part of a function we define. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice the reference to JSON objects. Luckily, we use Twarc to convert these into a `DataFrame`. Still, in the next section, you will need to become more familiar with JSON objects given how prevalent they are as a data type.  "

We assumed that these feelings might help us indicate how, say, the stock will perform in the near future. We also read about a more thorough and technical approach, which includes tokenizing, normalizing, and denoising the text data before using a Naive Bayes Classifier model to determine which words (and/or emoticons) are most informative about whether a tweet is emotionally positive or negative."
