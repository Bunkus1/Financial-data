    "## 3. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we performed fundamental analysis with the help of a repo that does all the relevant calculations. It also uses the Urllib module, which we learned more about. We also used an API (application programming interface), like we did in Lesson 1. In this module, we learned about sentiment analysis, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis. We also focused on time series analysis and correlation in the last lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see in this module, financial engineering techniques, even just those used to forecast stock prices, can be quite varied. In each of these lessons, we have presented a single approach to provide a small sample of the wide-ranging types of analysis that are being pursued, actively developed, and combined in the search for better, more predictive models. This innovative process is both disciplined and creative: IT requires sufficient understanding and command of the domain knowledge (for example, regarding the specific markets) and technical knowledge (the quantitative and coding techniques). This knowledge is necessary for improving existing techniques, borrowing techniques from other fields to apply to the market or some other financial topic, or a novel combination of both of these in a thoughtful new approach."
