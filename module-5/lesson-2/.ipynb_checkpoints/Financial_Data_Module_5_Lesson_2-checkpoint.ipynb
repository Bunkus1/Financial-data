The minimum required return expected for a bond investor is equal to the sum of the following, which accounts for this spread between corporate bonds and risk-free bonds:\n",

Government bonds are available in greater supply than even the most liquid corporates and have demand from a wider set of institutional investors. In addition, government bonds can be used more readily as collateral in repo transactions and for centrally cleared derivatives.\n",
    "* **Maturity Premium** – Compensates investors for the risk associated with bonds that mature many years into the future, which inherently carry more risk.\n",
    "* **Taxation Premium** – Compensates investors for the taxable income that bonds generate. Interest income on U.S. corporate bonds is taxable by both the federal and state governments. Government debt, however, is exempt from taxes at the state level.\n",

Knowing that differences in liquidity within the universe of corporate bonds are great, we use the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index Fund ETF Shares (VCSH) as a proxy for short-term maturity bonds.
