    "While this is still a positive return, it’s a much lower return than what we would’ve gotten with Ford, Amazon, or Bitcoin. This is to be expected for the most part as bonds return a quarterly/annual coupon along with returning the principal. For this reason, bonds (especially government bonds) are considered safer assets than stocks or cryptocurrencies. One major thing to consider is if a company goes bankrupt, you may not get your principal back in a bond. That being said, the same goes for stocks. Bondholders also have less credit risk than stockholders: If you own a bond in Ford and your friend owns Ford stock, but Ford declares bankruptcy tomorrow, the bondholder will be paid off first in the bankruptcy proceedings and the equity owner will only get what’s left over, making bonds a safer investment. \n",

Think back to the reading in this lesson for a moment. What we just discussed here is mentioned in the reading comparing a high-variance investment to a low-variance investment. What you choose is entirely up to your risk preferences. Always take into consideration the risk-reward tradeoff.\n",

    "Most investors hold a mix of stocks/cryptocurrencies and bonds. A rule of thumb that’s commonly used to determine this mix is to subtract your age from 100; the resulting number is the percentage of assets that should be in risky assets, like stocks. In other words, a 26-year-old should be putting (100-26) = 74% of their assets in stocks and 26% in bonds. The reason for this is that, while you’re young, you have more time to wait out the potential down cycles in a market so you can be riskier with your money.\n",
