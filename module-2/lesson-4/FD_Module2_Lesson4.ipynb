    "## 2. Are Stock Returns Normally Distributed?\n",
    "The normal distribution is one of the most common distributions used in modeling random variables. Indeed, many phenomena in the natural and social sciences can be modeled by normal distribution. One of the great advantages of the normal distribution is its simplicity. We can completely describe a normal distribution through two numbers: one for the center of the distribution and one for the uncertainty about that center. The first number refers to the mean, and the second number refers to the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have these two numbers, we can draw inferences, estimate percentiles, compute probabilities that a point falls within a region, and more. If our data is well-represented by the normal distribution, then we can confidently use the mean and standard deviation to report our portfolio expected returns and volatilities. If our data is not well represented by the normal distribution, then we need to find other distributions that are more suitable. Thus, when we have a distribution of stock returns, for example, we'll want to start this assessment by visualizing the returns to see if they appear to be normal. Of course, we can follow this up with more quantitative assessments by running statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize the data using the hist() method. We pass in bins = 100 as a parameter to determine the amount of buckets to place the data in. The more bins you have, the more granular the data will look in a histogram. Increasing the bins too much may result in slightly noisy data, which will make it tougher to determine a normal distribution. The chart in Figure 3 looks like it could be normally distributed, but we need to be a little more scientific to determine if that's actually the case or not."
