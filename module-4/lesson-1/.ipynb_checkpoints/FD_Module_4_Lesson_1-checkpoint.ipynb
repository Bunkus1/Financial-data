    "In this lesson, we used two Python packages, `optionprice` and `opstrat`, to create and visualize options and their strategies. We examined the two methods of pricing options: analytical and numerical.  We examined option strategies that use single options and multiple options.  We related the level of bullishness or bearishness to the type of option strategy using combinations of calls and puts at different strikes.  In the next module, we examine the sensitivities of options to their underlying."
